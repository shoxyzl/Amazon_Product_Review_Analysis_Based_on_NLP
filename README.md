# Amazon_Product_Review_Analysis_Based_on_NLP
 This project, conducted from January 2023 to March 2023, focuses on natural language processing (NLP) for Amazon product reviews. Using Python, we performed various NLP techniques on a dataset of 650,000 Amazon product reviews. The steps included removing special characters, tokenizing, filtering stop words, and performing stemming and lemmatization.  To extract meaningful features, we employed techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and word embeddings using Word2Vec and GloVe. These approaches enhanced the quality of the data for further analysis.  We then constructed a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories. For this task, we utilized both traditional machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and naive Bayes, as well as deep learning techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.  To assess the performance of the models, we employed evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These measurements allowed us to quantify the effectiveness of our sentiment analysis model in accurately categorizing customer reviews.  Overall, this project showcases the power of NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in analyzing a vast amount of Amazon product reviews, providing valuable insights for understanding customer sentiments and feedback.
